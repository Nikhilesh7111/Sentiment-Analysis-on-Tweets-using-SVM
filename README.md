# Sentiment Analysis on Tweets using SVM

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and optimizing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for sentiment analysis of tweets. The primary objective is to classify tweets as positive or negative based on their content, using various feature extraction and preprocessing techniques.

## Key Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classification of tweet sentiments into positive or negative categories.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Implementation of effective methods to clean and prepare tweet data for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Exploration of different feature extraction techniques, including tokenization, to improve model accuracy.
- **Model Optimization**: Various strategies to optimize the SVM classifier for better performance.

## Technologies
- Python
- Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas

## Dataset
The project utilizes a sentiment dataset comprising tweets, each labeled as positive or negative. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and testing the SVM model.

## Implementation Details
- **Data Preprocessing and Tokenization**: Implementing functions to parse and preprocess tweet data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Developing a method to convert tweets into feature vectors.
- **Model Training and Testing**: Employing SVM for training the classifier and evaluating its performance using cross-validation.
- **Error Analysis**: Analyzing the classifierâ€™s performance and identifying areas for improvement.
- **Optimization Techniques**: Experimenting with different preprocessing, feature extraction methods, and SVM parameters to enhance model accuracy.

## Usage
The repository contains Python notebook files demonstrating the entire process, from data preprocessing to model optimization.

## Contributions
Contributions to improve the model or explore new feature extraction methods are welcome.
